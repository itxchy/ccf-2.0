					<h1>Cory Martin's Philosophy</h1>
					<p>
						Cory likes to take the role as a wellness coach to teach and 
						build healthy habits for his clients that are sustainable and 
						can be carried on for the rest of their lives. With the vast 
						amount of information available to us about fitness and nutrition, 
						he helps his clients navigate those waters and determine 
						what information is real and what is pseudoscience. All of 
						his information will be backed by real science and proven studies. 
						Whether your goals are weight loss, strength, muscle building, 
						or just being more active, he approaches it from the same philosophy. 
						By striving to make the body as healthy as possible with wellness 
						in mind, you will see the most changes internally (How you feel.) 
						and externally ( How you look.) Under his guidance, he gives the 
						tools to his clients, so they can take charge of their own wellness 
						journey.
